            <div>
                <p>
                    The MLB Stats Explorer was created using the same data that a lot of the major sports sites use. The data
                    is an aggregation from <a href="https://www.retrosheet.org/" target="_blank">Retrosheet</a> and
                    <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/" target="_blank">Baseball Reference</a>. The data being used in this
                    application was obtained from the <a href="http://chadwick-bureau.com/" target="_blank">Chadwick Bureau's</a> GitHub
                    Repository, the <a href="https://github.com/chadwickbureau/baseballdatabank" target="_blank">Baseball Data Bank</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The data provided by Chadwick is in the format of csvs (which are quite large in size). For this site,
                    I have modeled those csv files in a <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a> database which is
                    accessible through a REST API that I developed in <a href="https://nodejs.org" target="_blank">Node.js</a>.
                    through my REST API written in Node.js

            <h3>The Data</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    With data covering the majority of baseballs history, there are a lot of statistics we can look into. Players,
                    Managers, Teams, Ballparks, Post Season, Hitting, Pitching, Fielding, you name it, it's available. The goal
                    of the MLB Stats Explorer is to enable user to dig into that data and find what they are looking for. With
                    all of the data available to you, you can easily get what you're after.
